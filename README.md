### Project Description

SalmonBot is a personal assistant program that allows a user to complete daily productivity tasks, like finding the weather, getting the time, viewing popular social media posts, and setting/viewing events on a calendar. There are also several distractions and diversions in the program for the user to play around with.

Python version 3.7 is needed for this program to operate. Download python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ <br>
**Note: This Program is currently only supported for Windows operating systems. Mac users can try and figure out how to install the dependencies on their machine, but automatic installation is not supported for Mac at this time.**

### Running the Program:

To run the program, the user must first run the setup.py file, which will make sure that the user has all of the dependencies required for the program to run. This only needs to be run once.

Afterward, the user can run the MenuApp.py file and the program will start automatically.
